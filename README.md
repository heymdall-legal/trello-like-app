# Requirements

App functionality:
- A user should be able to add and label columns.
- A user should be able to add and edit cards.
- A user should be able to move cards between columns (UX is up to you, does not need to be drag-and-drop).
- Do make sure the available interactions are intuitive. In other words, we will be considering usability.
- Some kind of persistency (LocalStorage or SessionStorage) is encouraged, though not required.
- Any additional features you find important (feel free to elaborate in your README file about why you made certain choices).
